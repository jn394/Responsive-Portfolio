        <p>Hello World, my name is Junwah Ng or Jay for short. I'm a hardworking, organized, enthusiastic person that loves
            to watch movies. I wouldn't call myself a film buff, but I do spend way too much time on r/movies and watching
            video essays about how movies are made. Other than that I'm a typical joe that likes to code.</p>
        <p>I'm here learning in this bootcamp hoping to change careers. I was a structure engineer for about 4 years and wanted
            a change. So I decided to leave the company I was working at and started to learn coding. It was a tough desicion
            at first, but i think it was for the better. Now I'm free to purse my passion of coding.</p>
